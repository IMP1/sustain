  - **Feather** (from animals)
  - **Flint** (from the ground? near rivers?)
  - **Fur** (from animals)
  - **Log** (from large tree)
  - **Meat** (from animals)
  - **Metal Ore** (from surface veins)
  - **Stick** (from small trees)
  - **String** (from reeds? from animals)
  - **Stone** (from surface stones)

  - **Arrow** (crafted from 1 arrowhead + 1 stick + 1 feather + 1 string at a crafting table)
  - **Arrowhead** (crafted from flint at a crafting table // 1 flint -> 3 arrowheads)
  - **Axe** (crafted from 1 stick + 1 flint + 1 string at a crafting table)
  - **Charcoal** (crafted from 1 log at a campfire)
  - **Cooked Meat** (crafted from 1 meat at a campfire)
  - **Hammer** (crafted from 1 stick + 1 metal at a forge)
  - **Mallet** (crafted from 1 stick // requires Flint or Axe)
  - **Metal** (crafted from metal ore at a furnace // uses charcoal // 1 metal ore -> 1 metal)
  - **Nails** (crafted from metal at a forge // requires Hammer // 1 metal -> 4 nails)
  - **Pegs** (crafted from sticks at a crafting table // requires Flint or Axe // 1 stick -> 4 pegs)
  - **Plank** (crafted from logs at a crafting table // requires Flint or Axe // 1 log -> 2 planks)
  - **Rope** (crafted from 3 string)
  - **Saw** (crafted from 2 metal + 1 stick + 2 pegs at a forge)
  - **Snare**: Costs string (2) :: A small-enough animal triggering the snare will become trapped and eventually die. 
                                   Interacting with a "full" snare harvests the creature's materials. 
                                   Interacting with an "empty" snare reclaims it to be placed elsewhere.
